I needed practice with JavaScript's higher order functions as I was in situations where I understood them,
but couldn't seem to apply them when needed. 

Node School's Functional Javascript Workshop was recommended to practice the higher order functions like
.map()
.filter()
.reduce()


This project is to house and display my solutions working through Node School's Functional Javascript Workshop
